# Module example with jlink

In this example we play around with jlink. 

If you run `compile_and_create_executable.sh` the module will be compiled and an executable will be created and then run it. 

If you run `compile_and_create_java_runtime.sh` the module will be compiled and a custom java-runtime will be created, then the module will run on the custom java-runtime.
