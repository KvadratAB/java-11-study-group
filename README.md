# Examples created when training for Java 11 certification

Project is created with the intention to use the Dev container in VS Code, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

`examples` contains different examples. Examples should be contained in its own
directory and the information on how to run them should exist there as
well.

Tip: to be able to execute bash scripts, run this!
find ./ -type f -name *.sh -exec sed -i -e 's/\r$//' {} \;
